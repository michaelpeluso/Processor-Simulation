# Program Snippets
Here is a colleciton of small programming projects I have developed over the past years. Below is a brief explanation for each directory. View them individually to see a more in-depth description of each.
 
***

- ### Binary-to-Float
This repository contains two C programs that facilitate the conversion between floating-point numbers and their binary representations. The programs are named ftob.c and btof.c.

- ### BinarySearchTree
This Java project provides an implementation of a Binary Search Tree (BST). The BST is a fundamental data structure that allows for efficient searching, insertion, and removal of elements, providing an average-case time complexity of O(log n) for these operations.

- ### ML-Market-Insights
This analysis uncovers key trends in the AI-driven job market, highlighting industries with rapid AI adoption, in-demand technical skills, and salary correlations. The scripts provide insights for job seekers and employers to navigate their careers.
 
- ### Motion-Detector
This project is a simple implementation of real-time video motion detection using JavaScript and HTML5. It utilizes the user's webcam to capture live video feed, processes each frame, and highlights areas where motion is detected.

- ### Neural-Networks
Inspired by Andrew Trask's "Grokking Deep Learning", this repository contains files from his course repositry as well as personal scripts applying theories described in the book.
 
- ### Processor-Simulation
This Python program simulates task scheduling in an operating system environment. It supports three scheduling algorithms: Serial Computing (SC), Timesharing (TS), and Multitasking (MT). The program reads configuration details from a file named config.txt.

- ### Spacial-Hash
A 2D simulation of particles colliding particles, using a spacial hash to efficiently optimize collision detection from *O(nÂ²)* to *O(n+k)*.
