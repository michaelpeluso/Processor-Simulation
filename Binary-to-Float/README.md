A C program that prints the binary values of a floating point number which is passed as a parameter. 

For example, 
"0 01111110 10000000000000000000000" would be printed when passed "ftob 0.75" 
"0 01111101 00110011001100110011010" would be printed when passed "ftob 0.3"

"btof 0.75" would be printed when passed "0 01111110 10000000000000000000000"
"btof 0.3" would be printed when passed "0 01111101 00110011001100110011010"
