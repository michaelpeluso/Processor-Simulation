A C program that prints the binary values of a floating point number, and vise versa, when passed a parameter.

For example, 
"00111111010000000000000000000000" would be printed when passed "ftob 0.75"\
"00111110100110011001100110011010" would be printed when passed "ftob 0.3"


"0.75" would be printed when passed "btof 00111111010000000000000000000000"\
"0.3" would be printed when passed "btof 00111110100110011001100110011010"
